basic syntax:
=============


        #content a {
          transition-property: all; 
          transition-duration: 1s; 
          transition-timing-function: ease;
          transition-delay: 0s;
        }
The transition shorthand property
==================================


As we've already seen however, we can roll these individual declarations into a single, 

shorthand version:


       transition: all 1s ease 0s;
